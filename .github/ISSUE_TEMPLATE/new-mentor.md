To apply please edit `_includes/mentors.md` to add an entry for yourself and open a PR with the changes.

If this is your first time contributing to open source check out https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution for guidance on how to submit a contribution.

The various recommended sections are documented below along with an example of how to format it.

Preferred Name: This is optional, you can go by just your online handle if you prefer.

Github Handle: This can be any handle - GitHub is just recommended - but this section is not a substitute for the contact section.

Pronouns: This section is optional. If you'd prefer to leave this blank or remove it, that's fine, but it's helpful to gender non-conforming people if everyone lists their pronouns so they don't feel singled out; normalizing specifying your pronouns gives everyone more freedom of expression.

Contact: Your preferred method of contact.

Spoken Languages: Languages you're comfortable mentoring in; if you do not specify this, English will be assumed. Please _emphasise_ your preferred language if you list more than one.

Topics: Topics of interest or projects that you work on that you're comfortable mentoring.

Additional Resources: Any other learning resources that you maintain that you would like to share.
